# Circuit_Simulator
We can simulate any circuit made with only using resistor and a battery and the app will calculate all the relevant properties of that circuit such as equivalent resistance of the whole assembly, current through any resistor and the corresponding voltage drop across it.


It stores the circuit as a non directed graph where edges are resistors and calculates the voltage of every node by solving linear equations we get after applying KVL in every node points of the said graph.


We input the resistance of the resistor using an Input Wheel.
